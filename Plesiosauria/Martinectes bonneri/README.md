## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype KUVP 40002. The precaudal vertebral formula is 19 cervicals+3 pectorals+22 dorsals+3 sacrals[^1].
It has also been argued that there are 21 cervical vertebrae, but such a discrepancy
is due to different views of the transition point from the cervical to the pectoral vertebrae[^2].
Another study designated 23 dorsals for KUVP 40002[^3], but neither of these two opposing studies re-specified
the vertebral formula. Therefore, the presacral formula proposed in [^1] was applied in this study, and
the total number should be correct despite the discrepancy in vertebral identification. The number
of preserved caudals, on the other hand, seems too few for the tail of a polycotylid (e.g., 26 are
present in *Dolichorhynchops osborni* FHSM VP404[^4]).

The SKL was estimated using the skull-neck formula, then the BSL was computed according to the BSL/SKL proportion of *D. osborni* FHSM VP404[^5]. The combined length of the pectoral and dorsal regions was restored by comparing the dorsal
measurements with those of FHSM VP404[^4]. The trunk length was estimated using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of 
*D. osborni* KUVP 1300[^6]. The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, and 5%
extra tail length representing soft tissues was added.

The  measured or estimated length of each body section is
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals+dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 846 mm | 815 mm    | 1595 mm           | 64 mm    | 1653 mm | 1619 mm | 4939 mm |

Measurements of the limbs of KUVP 40002 are from [^1]. Estimated values (using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^7]) are marked
with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 526 mm           | 320 mm          | $\star$ 1346 mm |
| hindlimb | 515 mm           | 300 mm          | 1440 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the mounted specimen GPIT-RE-3182, which was described in [^1]. There are 17 cervicals, 5 pectorals, 20 dorsals, 2 sacrals, and 17 caudals preserved, and only the atlas, axis, and some posterior caudals are missing. 
Therefore, the presacral number is 44, which is consistent with that of NHMUK PV R3318, another specimen of *P.
philarchus*[^2]. Although the vertebral formulae are different in these two individuals (21 or 22 cervicals
and 2 or 3 pectorals are present in NHMUK R3318), other plesiosaurs have offered examples of
intraspecific variations in vertebral formula under a constant presacral number[^3].
Historical photos demonstrate that GPIT-RE-3182 has been modified[^4]. The current look of the mount is quite different
from the previous one but resembles the reconstruction based on NHMUK PV R3318 figured in [^2].
It is possible that this mount was modified according to it, but such a suspicion can’t be confirmed.

The vertebral measurements were not provided in literature due to fossil distortion. Therefore,
the lengths of different postcranial regions were cited from literature or measured along the column
from the strictly right view photo (provided by Anna Khral). The total length of the current mount is
4200 mm in a direct line[^5]. The skull of GPIT-RE-3182 was deformed by crushing, but the mandible
remains undamaged. In the current mount, the upper jaw is longer than the mandible, which does
not fit with the morphology of NHMUK PV R4058 (a perfectly preserved skull of *P. philarchus*[^6]).
Subtracting the extra length of the upper jaw leads to a 700 mm BSL. The cervical, pectoral, and dorsal regions along the
vertebral column were acquired using the photogrammetric method. The length of the first sacral vertebra (including intervertebral cartilage anterior to it) was set to the average length of pectorals and dorsals. Five percent extra tail length, representing soft tissues, was added to the tail measurement. The trunk length was computed using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of the [*Sachicasaurus vitae* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/main/Plesiosauria/Sachicasaurus%20vitae).

The measured or estimated length of each body section is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals+dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| 700 mm | 747 mm    | 1430 mm           | 62 mm    | 1483 mm | 1398 mm | 4337 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^1]. Estimated values (using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^7]) are marked with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 380 mm           | 206 mm          | $\star$ 1165 mm |
| hindlimb | 425 mm           | 205 mm          | 1210 mm |

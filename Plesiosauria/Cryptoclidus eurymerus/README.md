## Model Construction

This model is based on the neotype NHMUK PV R2860. The presacral vertebral formula is 32 cervicals+3 pectorals+20 dorsals.
No study provided complete measurements of the cervical series of NHMUK PV R2860,
hence the cervical region was reproduced from the reconstruction provided in [^1].
The  pectoral and dorsal vertebral measurements and the restored spinal curvature provided in [^2] were employed in the current reconstruction. The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail equation, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues added.

Estimated length of each region along the main axis is:
| BSL+cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 1410 mm   | 126 mm    | 968 mm | 48 mm    | 1133 mm | 1201 mm | 3753 mm |

Measurements of the limbs of NHMUK R2860 are from [^3]. The limb lengths were restored according to NHMUK PV R8575 (restored in [^4]) and NHMUK PR R3703[^3].

|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 285 mm           | 214 mm          | $\star$ 817 mm |
| hindlimb | 270 mm           | 160 mm          | $\star$ 886 mm |

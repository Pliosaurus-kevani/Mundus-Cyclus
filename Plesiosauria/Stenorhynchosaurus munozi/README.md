## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype VL17052004-1. The two cervicals disarticulated from the column, as mentioned in [^1], is considered here as the 6th and 9th. The atlas and axis
of VL17052004-1 are obscured by the skull, hence their dimensions are unknown. However, the
sum of their lengths equals the difference of SKL and BSL, so the estimated body length
wouldnâ€™t be affected. Complete vertebral measurements were not provided in either [^1] or [^2],
and there are differences in their data. The vertebral dimensions used in this study are
mainly from [^2], with the dimensions of cervicals 1, 2, 6, 11 replaced by those provided in [^1].
The combined length of the pectorals, dorsals, and the first sacral vertebra was computed using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$
proportion of the [*Sachicasaurus vitae* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/main/Plesiosauria/Sachicasaurus%20vitae).  The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues added.

The measured or estimated length of each body section is:
| BSL+cervicals | pectorals+dorsals+sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:-------------:|:--------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 1908 mm       | 2089 mm                    | 2077 mm | 1954 mm | 5951 mm |

Measurements of the limbs of VL17052004-1 are from [^1]:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 665 mm           | 225 mm          | 1480 mm |
| hindlimb | 810 mm           | 250 mm          | 1575 mm |

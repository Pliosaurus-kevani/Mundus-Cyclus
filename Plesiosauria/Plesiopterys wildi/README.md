## Model Construction

This model is based on the individual MH 7[^1]. The mandibular length is comparable to that of *Seeleyosaurus guilelmiimperatoris* SMNS 12039, and the BSL was estimated at 179 mm using the proportion of the skull reconstruction of *S. guilelmiimperatoris*[^2]. The cervical region is 1081 mm in length, and the trunk length is 842 mm. The combined length of pectorals, dorsals, and the first sacral vertebra was estimated using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of the [*Seeleyosaurus guilelmiimperatoris* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/3f42d06a936ddd309c7f26efef94b6ec95662a8d/Plesiosauria/Seeleyosaurus%20guilelmiimperatoris). 5% extra length representing soft tissue was added to the tail tip. 

The estimated length of each body section is 
| BSL     | cervicals | pectorals + dorsals + sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:-------:|:---------:|:------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 179 mm | 1081 mm   | 856 mm   | 842 mm | 913 mm | 3029 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^1]. The limb elements are largely complete but slightly disarticulated, hence they were reassembled during reconstruction.

|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 214 mm           | 113 mm          | 686 mm |
| hindlimb | 213 mm           | 113 mm          | 717 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the individual YPM 1125. All data employed during reconstruction are from the research notes of Samuel P. Welles,
provided by Bruce A. Schumacher (pers. comm, 2022). The presacral vertebral formula of YPM 1125 is 26 cervicals+4 pectorals+24 dorsals. The SKL was estimated at 628 mm using the skull-neck formula. On the other hand, comparing the cervical lengths of YPM 1125 with those of *P. latipinnis* SDSM 23020, which possesses a relatively complete skull[^1], leads to a 781 mm SKL.  Taking the average, the final estimate was 705 mm. Then BSL was estimated using the $\frac{\text{BSL}}{\text{SKL}}$ ratio of SDSM 23020[^1]. 
Lengths of the unmeasurable dorsals were restored by taking the average values of adjacent ones. The trunk length was estimated using the  $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of *D. osborni* KUVP 1300[^2]. The tail length was computed using the trunk-tail formula, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues added.

The estimated length of each body section is 
| BSL     | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:-------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 677 mm | 1179 mm   | 184 mm    | 1381 mm | 61 mm   | 1620 mm | 1592 mm | 5074 mm |

The forelimb measurements are from Welles' note. The hindlimbs of YPM 1125 are not preserved, and the dimensions were estimated according to the humerus/femur proportion of LACM 129639[^3]. The flipper lengths estimated using the 
chord-flipper formula[^4] seem too long and are incompatible with the preserved part of SDSM 23020[^1]. Therefore, the total lengths of the forelimb and hindlimb were reconstructed based on the $\frac{\text{humerus length}}{\text{forelimb length}}$ and $\frac{\text{femur length}}{\text{hindlimb length}}$ ratios of *D. osborni* FHSM VP404[^5]. All estimated values are marked with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 400 mm           | 230 mm          | $\star$ 1016 mm |
| hindlimb | $\star$ 428 mm           | $\star$ 215 mm          | $\star$ 1036 mm |

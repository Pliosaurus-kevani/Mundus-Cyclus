## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype MJACM 1. This individual was previously referred to the genus *Kronosaurus*[^1].
However, there were some misidentifications in that work (e.g., the vertebral formula[^2]), hence the
vertebral measurements were not employed in this reconstruction. The left rotation of the vertebral column
and generally articulated condition of this specimen also offer a good opportunity for acquiring the
lengths of different regions using the photogrammetric method.

The SKL of MJCAM1 is 2450 mm. Two or three cervicals are probably obscured by
the skull roof, hence the neck length can’t be measured. However, the length of the cervicals
obscured by the skull equals the difference between the SKL and the BSL, so the total length of the
model is not affected by this state of preservation. The lengths of the pectoral and dorsal regions were measured
along the column. The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues
added.

The measured or estimated length of each body section is:
| SKL     | remaining cervicals+pectorals | dorsals+sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:-------:|:-----------------------------:|:----------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 2450 mm | 908 mm                        | 3091 mm          | 3010 mm | 2661 mm | 9110 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^1][^2]:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 799 mm           | 321 mm          | 1870 mm |
| hindlimb | 977 mm           | 401 mm          | 2208 mm |

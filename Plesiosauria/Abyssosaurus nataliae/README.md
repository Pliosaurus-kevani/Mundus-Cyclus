## Model Construction
This model is based on the holotype of *Abyssosaurus nataliae* MChEIO PM/1. The presacral vertebral fomula is 51 cervicals+3 pectorals+21 dorsals[^1]. The SKL of *A. nataliae* was retored at 300 mm in [^1], and the BSL was estimated here at 274 mm using the BSL/SKL ratio of *Muraenosaurus leedsi*[^2]. Assuming that cryptoclidids were similar in spinal curvature, the trunk length was estimated using the body proportion of *Cryptoclidus eurymerus* NHMUK PV R2860[^3]. The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, and 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues was added.

Estimated length of each region along the main axis is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 274 mm | 2812 mm   | 215 mm    | 1589 mm | 66 mm    | 1853 mm | 1783 mm | 6739 mm |

Measurements of the limbs of are from [^1]. Estimated values (using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^4]) are marked with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 400 mm           | 190 mm          | $\star$ 1074 mm |
| hindlimb | 470 mm           | 230 mm          | $\star$ 1302 mm |

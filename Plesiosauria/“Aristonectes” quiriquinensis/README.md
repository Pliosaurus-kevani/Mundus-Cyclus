## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype of *“Aristonectes” quiriquinensis* (SGO.PV.957), with missing information retored according to a smaller individual SGO.PV.260, following [^1]. Attribution of this species to *Aristonectes* has been questioned recently[^2], but taxonomy is beyond the scope here. 

The BSL was measured from the reconstruction provided in [^1]. The vertebral formula is 43 cervicals+3 pectorals+24 dorsals+3 sacrals+35 caudals[^1]. The measurable cervicals were compared with the corresponding ones of *Microcleidus tournemirensis*
(which also possesses 43 cervical[^3]) to estimate the total length of the cervical series. The dimensions of dorsal vertebrae were compared with those of *Thalasomedon haningtoni*, which has 25 dorsals[^4]. The tail was reconstructed by scaling the articulated caudal
series of SGO.PV.260[^1], with lengths of the missing caudals restored based on the anteriormost one in the preserved series. 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues was added.

The estimated length of each region along the main axis is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacrals | trunk   | caudals    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 574 mm | 3590 mm   | 332 mm    | 2377 mm | 221 mm    | 2773 mm | 2906 mm | 10000 mm |

Measurements of the limbs are from [^5]. The femur is incomplete and was estimated using the length/chord proportion of the preserved humerus. The total length of the hindlimb was estimated using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^6]:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 500 mm           | 270 mm          | 2288 mm |
| hindlimb | $\star$ 531 mm           | 287 mm          | $\star$ 2271 mm |

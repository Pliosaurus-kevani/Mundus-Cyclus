## Model Construction
Two individuals were selected to make a composite model of *Pliosaurus*: 
*P.* cf. *kevani* CAMSM J.35990 and *P. funkei* PMO 214.135. Assuming the same body proportion, the two individuals were
comparable in body size, judging from their vertebral dimensions[^1].

The cervical series of *Pliosaurus* can be divided into the anterior cervicals and the
posterior ones by their distinct morphology[^2]. Neither PMO 214.135 nor CAMSM J.35990 contains
a complete vertebral column[^1][^3], hence the presacral formula of *P. brachyspondylus* CAMSM J. 35991
(19 cervicals+2 pectorals+24 dorsals[^4]) is applied here. Three pectoral vertebrae are present in PMO 214.135[^1], but this is
not controversial, as the number of pectoral vertebrae in plesiosaurs is often arbitrary, while the total
number of presacral vertebrae remains the same[^5]. Therefore, the presacral formula of this model is
modified to 19 cervicals+3 pectorals+23 dorsals. Assuming that the anterior cervicals are from the anterior half of the
neck, the average cervical length of CAMSM J. 35990 was calculated as  

$$\text{average} = \dfrac{\text{average length of anterior cervicals} \times 10 + \text{average length of posterior cervicals} \times 9}{19}$$

Neither CAMSMJ.35990 nor PMO214.135 possesses a complete skull, hence the SKLs of them
were estimated using the skull-neck formula, leading to a 1850 mm result. A comparison
with *P. brachyspondylus* CAMSM J. 35991[^4] was also performed, and the result is 2168 mm. The
average value (2009 mm) of these two results was taken and set as the SKL of the model.
The BSL was then computed according to the BSL/SKL proportion of *P. kevani* DORCM G. 13675[^6].
A composite model is proposed for the trunk region. The pectorals were set to 91 mm + 100 mm + 100 mm, a combination of the preserved and measurable ones of PMO 214.135 and
CAMSM J.35990[^1][^3]. The dorsal series of PMO 214.135 is more complete, hence it was
compared with that of *Brachauchenius lucasi* USNM 4989[^7] to estimate the length along the dorsal
series (with vertebral number correctly modified). No sacral or caudal vertebrae of PMO 214.135 are preserved[^1], and only four caudal vertebrae are known from CAMSM J.35990[^3]. The length of the first sacral vertebra was then set to the average length
of the dorsals. The trunk length was computed using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of the
[*Sachicasaurus vitae* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/main/Plesiosauria/Sachicasaurus%20vitae).
The tail length was calculated using the trunk-tail formula, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues added.

The estimated length of each body section is
| BSL     | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:-------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 1815 mm | 1713 mm   | 320 mm    | 2900 mm | 126 mm   | 3327 mm | 2917 mm | 9791 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^1][^3]. The hindlimbs of PMO 214.135 are not preserved, hence they were restored
according to the proportion of CAMSM J. 35990. The flipper lengths were estimated using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^8].
Estimated values are marked with a $\star$:
|    *P.* cf. *kevani*      | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 840 mm           | 308 mm          | $\star$ 1745 mm |
| hindlimb | 960 mm           | 360 mm          | $\star$ 2042 mm |

|    *P. funkei*      | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 1000 mm           | 400 mm          | $\star$ 2270 mm |
| hindlimb | $\star$ 1248 mm           | $\star$ 468 mm          | $\star$ 2657 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype of *Brancasaurus brancai* GPMM A3.B4. The BSL was measured from the figure provided in [^1]. The vertebral formula is 37 cervicals+3 pectorals+19 dorsals+3 sacrals+25 caudals[^1]. The vertebral dimensions were from [^1], and 7.2% of intercervical distances were added according to *Seeleyosaurus guilelmiimperatoris* SMNS 12039[^2], due to their similarity in cervical count. The spinal curvature was restored according to the current mount. Lengths of caudals 23~25 were all set to 13 mm as caudal 22. 10% of the intervertebral distance was added to the pectoral, dorsal, and sacral regions, and 20% to the caudals. 

The estimated length of each region along the main axis is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 236 mm | 1265 mm   | 123 mm    | 686 mm | 33 mm    | 840 mm | 705 mm | 3048 mm |

Measurements of the limbs of GPMM A3.B4. are cited from [^1]. The length of the forelimb was estimated using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^3]. The estimated value is marked with a $\star$:

|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 230 mm           | 130 mm          | $\star$ 734 mm |
| hindlimb |  215 mm           | 124 mm          |  770 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype MLP 93-I-5-1. The preserved vertebral formula of is 54 cervicals+3 pectorals+17 dorsals+3 sacrals+28 caudals, with some caudals and the skull missing[^1]. The lengths of different body sections along the vertebral column were estimated by comparing the measurable vertebrae with corresponding ones of *Hydrotherosaurus alexandrae* UCMP
33912[^2], then the vertebral numbers of different regions were modified. The SKL was estimated using the skull-neck formula, then the BSL was calculated according to the BSL/SKL proportion of *Thalassomedon haningtoni* DMNH 1588[^3]. The trunk length was estimated using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of the [*Albertonectes vanderveldei* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/main/Plesiosauria/Albertonectes%20vanderveldei) .
The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, and 5%
extra tail length representing soft tissues was added.

The estimated length of each body section is
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail   | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 262 mm | 3052 mm   | 198 mm    | 1155 mm | 66 mm    | 1414 mm | 1435 mm | 6168 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^1]. Estimated values (using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^4]) are marked with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 298 mm          | 235 mm          | $\star$ 1330 mm |
| hindlimb | 280 mm           | 190 mm          |$\star$ 1074 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the mounted specimen GPIT-RE-3184. It was an old
mount described in detail in [^1]. The fossil specimen contains 15 cervicals, 3 pectorals, 21 dorsals,
and 13 caudals[^1]. The photos taken in the last century suggest that this mount has been greatly
modified, and the current one in the exhibition contains 22 cervicals, 3 pectorals, and 23 dorsals (pers. orbs., Zhao),
similar to the vertebral formula of NHMUK PV R3536, another individual of *L. ferox*[^2].
It is possible that the current mount was restored according to it, but this suspicion can not be confirmed.

It was argued that the poor preservation status of the vertebrae precludes measurements[^1]. Therefore,
the lengths of different presacral regions were measured along the vertebral column from the
strict right view photo (provided by Anna Khral). The intervertebral distances between the adjacent
vertebrae may not fit with the criteria proposed in [Zhao, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.578844), but a better reconstruction is not applicable in the current stage.
It is also noteworthy that there are two other relatively complete
specimens of *L. ferox*, ComCom Thouarsais Geol.0121[^3] and NHMUK PV R3536[^2]. However, the
skull, part of the neck, and a great portion of the tail are absent from the former specimen, and the
detailed reappraisal of the latter has not yet been published. Consequently, there aren’t any detailed
vertebral measurements currently available.

The BSL of GPIT-RE-3184 is 920 mm[^1], and the total length of the mount in a direct line
is 4880 mm[^4]. The
length of the first sacral was set to the average length of the pectorals and the dorsals, which is
73 mm including the intervertebral cartilage anterior to it. The trunk length was estimated using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of the [*Sachicasaurus vitae* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/main/Plesiosauria/Sachicasaurus%20vitae). It was argued in [^2] that *L. ferox* possessed 25 ~ 30 caudals in life, but 
which specimen was referred to was not elaborated. 
In comparison with other plesiosaurs exhibiting a complete caudal series (e.g.,
*Peloneustes philarchus*[^2]), the tail in the current mount appears to be of insufficient length.
Therefore, the tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues added.

The measured or estimated length of each body section is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals+dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 920 mm | 1090 mm   | 1886 mm    | 73 mm | 1948 mm    | 1859 mm | 5828 mm | 

The limb measurements are from [^1]. Estimated values (using the chord-flipper formula provided in [^5]) are marked with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 402 mm           | 218 mm          | $\star$ 1233 mm |
| hindlimb | 520 mm           | 285 mm          | $\star$ 1614 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype SMNS 12478. The vertebral formula is uncertain since the girdles obscure the dorsal series. In the first description in 1910[^1], 27 cervicals+6 pectorals+25 dorsals+2 sacrals +39 caudals were proposed. The more recent reappraisal suggests 30 cervical vertebrae[^2]; hence the formula employed here is modified to 30+3+25+2+39. However, the uncertainty in vertebral formula does not influence the size estimate, since the trunk length is known. The spinal curvature was restored according to the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ proportion of the *Rhomaleosaurus* model provided in [^3]. Five percent extra tail length representing soft tissues was added.

The measured or estimated length of each body section is
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals+dorsals+sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:--------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 305 mm | 817 mm    | 1106 mm                    | 1100 mm | 1163 mm | 3391 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^2]:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 420 mm           | 193 mm          | 1110 mm |
| hindlimb | 385 mm           | 157 mm          | 1041 mm |

## Model Construction

This model is based on the holotype of *Nichollssaura borealis* TMP 1994.122.0001. The measurements were taken using the photogrammetric method in AutoCAD based on the dorsal view photo provided in [^1]. Length of the articulated cervical series is 640 mm[^2]. Measured from the dorsal view photo, the trunk length is 875 mm, and the tail length is 812 mm. The spinal curvature was restored according to the mount of *Brancasaurus brancai* GPMM A3.B4.[^3]. With 5% extra tail length representing soft tissue
added, the total length along the vertebral column was estimated at 2708 mm.

Measurements of the limbs are provided below:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 203 mm           | 104 mm          | 530 mm |
| hindlimb | 177 mm           | 109 mm          | 532 mm |

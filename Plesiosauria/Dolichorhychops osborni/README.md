## Model Construction

This model is based on the individual FHSM VP404. The BSL employed here is cited from [^1]. The presacral vertebral formula of *D. osborni* is 19 cervicals+ 3 pectorals+23/24 dorsals[^1][^2], and the latter was adopted for this model. Detailed vertebral measurments were from [^2]. Intervertebral distances in the current model were restored according to the criteria proposed in [Zhao, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.578844). Lengths of the unmeasurable dorsals were set to the
average length of the rest of the dorsals, and the lengths of caudals 24~26 were all set to 13 mm as caudal 23. The trunk length was estimated using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ ratio of KUVP 1300. The intercaudal distance was defined as 10% of the length of the adjacent caudal, and 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues were added.

The estimated or measured length of each region along the main axis is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail    | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 500 mm | 603 mm   | 101 mm    | 925 mm | 40 mm    | 1062 mm | 789 mm | 2958 mm |

Measurements of the limbs of FHSM VP404 are cited from [^2]:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | 336 mm           | 168 mm          |  813 mm |
| hindlimb | 330 mm           | 187 mm          |  838 mm |

**note: see [Zhao, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.578844) for abbreviations and reconstruction criteria.**

Opinions on the taxonomic status of a bunch of pliosaurs from the Toolebuc Formation or the Doncaster Formation, previously referred to *Kronosaurus* or *Eiectus*, havenâ€™t reached consensus[^1][^2]. Taxonomy is beyond the scope here, and a single model was established based on the individual MCZ 1285.

There exists debate on the presacral vertebral formula of this individual. For example, 12 cervicals+2 pectorals+30 dorsals was proposed in [^3], 13+3+19 in [^4], and (> 9)+2+26 in [^1]. Here a presacral vertebral formula of 12+2+22 is proposed after reviewing the previous arguments. The following vertebrae are considered valid in this model (the catalogue numbers are from [^4]):  
cervicals: V1 ~ 12;  
pectorals: V13 ~ 14;  
dorsals: V15, V16, V18 ~ 22, V26 ~ 29, V32, V33, V35 ~ 43;  

The BSL and the vertebral measurements are from [^4]. The intervertebral distances were restored according to the criteria proposed in 
[Zhao, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.15.578844). The trunk length was estimated using the $\frac{\text{P+D+S1}}{\text{trunk}}$ ratio of the [*Sachicasaurus vitae* model](https://github.com/Pliosaurus-kevani/Mundus-Cyclus/tree/main/Plesiosauria/Sachicasaurus%20vitae). The tail length was estimated using the trunk-tail formula, with 5% extra tail length representing soft tissues added.

The estimated length of each body section is:
| BSL    | cervicals | pectorals | dorsals | sacral 1 | trunk   | tail   | total   |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 2210 mm | 1471 mm   | 222 mm    | 3265 mm | 149 mm    | 3615 mm | 3099 mm | 10416 mm |

The limb measurements are from [^3]. The forelimbs of MCZ 1285 are not preserved, and the humerus length was estimated using the humerus/femur proportion of QM F10113[^4]. Estimated values are marked with a $\star$:
|          | propodial length | chord propodial | total length   |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| forelimb | $\star$ 766 mm           | $\star$ 289 mm          | $\star$ 1662 mm |
| hindlimb | 1060 mm           | 400 mm          |2300 mm |
